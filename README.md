# EMEA Ambassadors: Containerlab Session, Aug 2022

> This repository is a step-by-step guide explaining how to build the demo lab presented on the Arista EMEA Ambassadors session, Aug 2022.

## Prerequisites

To build the lab an Ubuntu LTS VM is required.  We will be using Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS in this guide.  
You can use a hypervisor of your choice, but this guide will only provide an example of deploying Ubuntu Cloud Image on KVM. The KVM hypervisor setup is not covered in this document. You can check [this repository](https://github.com/arista-netdevops-community/kvm-lab-for-network-engineers) to learn how to build a KVM lab host.
